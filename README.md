# Bank Customer Churn Prediction Using ANN and H2O AutoML

## The primary objective of this project is to leverage machine learning algorithms to identify and predict customer churn. By examining various customer behaviors and attributes through data analysis and feature engineering, the project aims to develop a predictive model that can accurately classify customers at risk of churning. Furthermore, the model is expected to assign a probability to the churn prediction, which will enable targeted customer retention initiatives, focusing on those most likely to churn (the "low hanging fruits"). This probabilistic approach is intended to optimize resource allocation in customer service and retention efforts, ultimately reducing churn and increasing overall customer satisfaction.
